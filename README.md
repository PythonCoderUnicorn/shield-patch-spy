# shield-patch-spy
a repo for cyber security game based off "Rock, Paper, Scissors" 

---

Players: Two cybersecurity professionals (you and your opponent)

Objective: Each round, choose one of the three options to defend your system from a simulated cyberattack. The winner is the one who chooses the strategy that best counters the opponent's choice.

---

The Options:

Shield: This represents a strong defense perimeter. It's effective against brute-force attacks (like many login attempts with different passwords) but weak against targeted attacks that exploit specific vulnerabilities.

Patch: This represents applying security updates and fixing known vulnerabilities. It's effective against known exploits but can be slow to implement and might not address zero-day attacks (new, unknown vulnerabilities).

Spy: This represents proactive threat detection and monitoring. It can identify suspicious activities and potential attacks before they cause damage, but might miss well-crafted attacks designed to evade detection.

### example

Example Round:

You choose: Spy
Opponent chooses: Patch
Outcome: You win! Your proactive monitoring system detects the attacker trying to exploit a recently patched vulnerability, allowing you to take action before any damage is done.


### work in progress

- [ ] fully flesh out game rules
- [ ] make a python demo
- [ ] use some example from MITRE ATTACK framework
